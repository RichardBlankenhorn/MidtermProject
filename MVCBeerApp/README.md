#### Description

The objective of this project is to create an application to help unite beer lovers. It is well-known that there are too many craft breweries and beers for one person to keep up with. We help beer lovers share their favorite locations and beers and provide this data to those searching for a new beer or brewery, or trying to remember an old favorite. 

#### How To Run This Application

To run this application, a user starts at the home page and is provided with several options including but not limited to: creating an account, logging into an existing account, searching for a beer or brewery by keyword, or using a drop-down menu to filter a search by brewery name and beer type. Once a user creates an account and is logged in, functionality is significantly increased. Logged in users are able to add comments to a beer or brewery, update and delete those comments, and add their favorite beer or brewery so other users can find new things to try in their local area! Logged in users can also access their profile which allows them to view and update their personal details as well as change their password. The profile page also provides a convenient location to view all comments that user has left on any beer or brewery along with the ability to quickly view all comments left by all users on any beer or brewery! 

If a user elects not to create an account, they can still view comments left on any individual beer or brewery page, quickly search for any beer or brewery, or use the handy drop-down menu on the home page to filter their search by a specific beer and brewery combination. For example, a user may want to see if the brewery they're considering checking out has a specific IPA they like and this drop-down menu provides that functionality to our users, whether they have an account or not!  

When a user visits a beer page, the name of the beer, Alcohol by Volume (ABV), cost, description, category, International Bitterness (or "Bittering") Unit (IBU),  and the brewery that created the beer are all provided, along with comments left by users. If a user is logged in, they are also provided the option to add a comment to that beer, or update/delete a previously submitted comment.

When a user visits a brewery page, the name of the brewery, address/contact information, and user comments are displayed along with a link to the brewery's website. Just like the beer page, if a user is logged in, they are also provided the option to add a comment to that brewery, or update/delete a previously submitted comment. Also embedded on the page is the Google Maps API with a pin highlighting the location of the brewery so a user can get a rough idea of where the brewery is located before making a decision on whether or not to check it out! If a user decides they would like to visit the brewery, there's a convenient link to Google Maps that has the destination information of that brewery already populated. All a user has to do is input their current location as the starting point, and they're good to go!  

In order for a user to add their favorite craft beer or brewery, they must be logged in. Once logged in, the user will see a drop-down menu at the top of the page labeled "Beer & Brewery". The user simply has to hover over this link, and the option to add a beer or brewery will be displayed. Just fill out the required fields in the form and that's it! The new beer or brewery will immediately be made available to other users, however, our team of developers will review the submission and ensure the beer or brewery additions are valid.

Our goal is simple: provide a user experience that is simple, elegant, and refined so a user can easily gather as much relevant information as possible to help them make an informed decision about their next beer or brewery!
